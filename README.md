PySoDa is an irradiance-based synthetic solar photovoltaic generation tool able to produce solar time series up to a 1-second resolution using the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). PySoDa uses NSRDB 30-min averages to generate stochastic time series using parameters learned from Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data
