SoDa is  an   irradiance-based  synthetic  Solar  Data  generation  tool  to  generate  realistic sub-minute  solar  photovoltaic  (PV)  output  power  time  series. Soda  emulates  the  weather  pattern  for  a  certain  geographical location using 30-min averaged irradiance and cloud type information from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)
